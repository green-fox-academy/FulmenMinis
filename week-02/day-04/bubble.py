# Sort that list
#    Create a function that takes a list of numbers as parameter
#    Returns a list where the elements are sorted in ascending numerical order
#    Make a second boolean parameter, if it's true sort that list descending - legyen nÃ¶v/csÃ¶kk True/False
# Example
# input [34, 12, 24, 9, 5]
# output [5, 9, 12, 24, 34]
