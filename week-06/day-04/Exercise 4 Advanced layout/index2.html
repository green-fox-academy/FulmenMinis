            <main class="top-left">Well, CSS Grid is the first real layout system for the web. It's designed for organizing content both into columns and rows and it finally gives developers almost God-like control of the screens before us. That means that we can finally ditch decades of hacks and workarounds for setting elements on a web page â€“ ultimately it means that complex layouts and beautifully typeset pages are now not only possible but easy and maintainable.</main>  
            <main class="top-right">This was a blockbuster week for front-end developers as CSS Grid landed in the latest versions of Firefox and Chrome without a feature flag. That's right: we can now go and play with Grid in two of the most popular browsers right away.</main>  
            <main class="bottom-left">OK, but how does Grid work? There are a lot of complex tutorials out there that go into an awful lot of detail but I think we should start with the very basics. What we'll be making here is a relatively simple type specimen, with a bunch of characters from an alphabet laid out on a page.</main>
